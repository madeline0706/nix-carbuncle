# All roads lead to Nix. It's true.

I have only been using Linux for two and a half years now. I briefly used it during the Filthy Frank era via an Ubuntu VM just so I could use LMAOBOX on casual 2fort, but beyond that, not really.

Since then, I did have to temporarily use Windows, for my sanity. Trying to get Debian to work on the Lenovo Legion 7 I had was always a disaster. The closest I got to "stability" was with CachyOS. Didn't quite like the vibes. I was still in college at the time, and many of my classes insisted on proprietary slop anyways, many of which did not have easy Linux support. A Windows VM or something like Winboat *could* have worked, but I didn't want to spend much of my free time just to do my homework.

My first real experience with Linux was with Linux Mint. It was just.. nice. I didn't last long though, as it felt quite dry and a bit boring. I wanted a challenge! Straight to the beloved Arch Linux, manually installing like a 1337 hax0r (I typed word for word what Mutahar wrote). Arch Linux was quite nice, it felt much more customizable and open, even though I had no idea what I was doing, and preferred GNOME of all things over KDE, Cinnamon, etc.

For a while I had no issues with Arch. I even tried to run a few servers with it, before I even knew what the hell a Docker was. It was rancid, but it worked, and I didn't know any better. I didn't even know how to properly setup backups.

I would say I stuck with Arch for at least a 6-8 months, but eventually decided, for my server at least, that I should run everything under Proxmox, which I still do. Proxmox is great. This time though, the actual servers would just rub Debian! Much more simple, stable, but outdated, but ultimately worked. 

My memory beyond that point is a little hazey, but I aimed to run all of my servers with Debian, and eventually had to use Windows for my Legion laptop, I do not miss it *at all*.

The idea of stability appealed to me, and that is where I decided to try Bazzite, after selling my Legion to a friend, to help fund the GPU for my current computer. I craved something that Just Worked, something that would be hard to break, and I wouldn't have to "waste" time tinkering with. This was solid, and got me by for a few months. Zero issues at all, other than the bugginess of the Steam overlay, which was incredibly inconsistent and I still fight to this day. Cmon Gabe.

Around this time, I recieved a free laptop, a Dell Pro 14, from a college scholarship program. It was wonderful, as I have been in need of something portable and with modest specs. But most importantly, free. Can't beat that :p

The laptop did not spend a single ***nanosecond*** on Windows. Straight to Bazzite it went. For... a little while. I realized I wanted something a bit more customizeable, and familiar, so after about a month I decided to give Debian a try. Worked great, but I wanted to switch things up a bit, GNOME, KDE, Cinnamon, none of them really appealed to me, I wanted something more customizeable, something a bit more lightweight, and most importantly, the aesthetics. Sway was my first choice. Simple, and does exactly what I needed it to do, launch Firefox. This worked perfect. I did not have any intentions of playing games on it, and one of my biggest fears of Linux was getting games to just.. work. Just as they did with Bazzite. I fought Linux Mint & Proton endlessly just to get games to run, even games that were native to Linux would freak out and shit the bed. 

One of the distrobutions I tinkered with during the Windows/Legion laptop era was NixOS, alongside Arch, Cachy, Linux Mint, and Debian. No clue what I did, but NixOS was *daunting*. I got a basic configuration working one evening, and it eventually just... broke? In hindsight I think it was my dumbass breaking the bootloader. I also, at the time, wasn't as good with Git, and I wanted to incorporate it into my Nix experiments at the time, not fun.

Eventually, I wanted to run Sway, on my Bazzite machine. Got tired of GNOME. KDE just irks me. Cinnamon is just... no. I had riced and cooked up my Sway configurations to perfection by this time, and wanted to run the same configuration as seamlessly as possible, it just felt right. 

I said fuck it, I am giving Arch a try again. Whats the worst that could go wrong? So I researched what exactly Bazzite was doing behind the scenes to make things just work, and from that, i learned how to build/use an alternate kernel, and optionally a scheduler, like BORE. CachyOS as the kernel, BORE, on Arch. It felt clean, but... over time it just felt like I was putting so much work into something that didn't really pay off like I wanted it to. Everything I did, I had to do on my Laptop too, or vice versa. It felt like a constant battle, and god forbid I switch devices or need to reinstall. I wanted something that I could spend time building, but also Just Worked. Obviously you can't have your cake and eat it too, but with NixOS, I found the perfect cake, one that I could eat the shit out of.

And eventually, in time, the road I was travelling eventually led to... NixOS.
